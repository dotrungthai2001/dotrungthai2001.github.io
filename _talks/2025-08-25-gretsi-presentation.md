This presentation covers our work on a novel reconstruction method for photoacoustic tomography (PAT), which was accepted for publication at GRETSI 2025.

In this talk, I discuss our proposed regularization strategy that combines Total Variation (TV) with a Cauchy prior. This approach is designed to enhance image quality and effectively reconstruct images from the limited or sparse data that is common in PAT systems.
