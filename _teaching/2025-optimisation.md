During the 2025-2026 academic year, I serve as a Teaching Assistant for the first-year Master's course "Optimisation". My responsibilities include leading 24 hours of tutorials (Travaux Dirigés) and 12 hours of practical lab sessions (Travaux Pratiques).

In these sessions, I guide students through the implementation and application of core optimisation algorithms using Python, reinforcing the theoretical concepts covered in lectures.
