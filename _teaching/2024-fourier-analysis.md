During the 2024-2025 academic year, I serve as a Teaching Assistant for the third-year undergraduate course **"Analyse de Fourier et théorie du signal"**.

My responsibilities include conducting 30 hours of practical work sessions (Travaux Practiques). In these tutorials, I guide students through exercises and applications of core concepts in Fourier analysis and signal theory, helping them bridge the gap between theoretical lectures and practical problem-solving.
