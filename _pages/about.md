Welcome to my personal website. I am a PhD student in Computer Science, splitting my time between the **Institut de Math√©matiques de Toulouse (IMT)** in France and the **Bioinformatics Institute (BII), A*STAR** in Singapore. My research is conducted within **IPAL (International Research Laboratory on Artificial Intelligence)**, a prestigious CNRS International Research Laboratory (IRL 2955).

## Research Interests

* Inverse problems for imaging
* Photoacoustic imaging
* Computational imaging
* Approximation and estimation of operators
* Machine/deep learning

## Doctoral Research Project

My PhD thesis (2024-2027) is titled **"Large-scale reconstruction methods for high-quality 3D photoacoustic imaging."** This project aims to design fast and accurate reconstruction methods to deploy a novel 3D photoacoustic tomography (PAT) scanner for use in biomedical studies.

My work is supervised by:
*   [**Dr. Paul Escande**](https://pescande.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) (CNRS, IMT)
*   [**Dr. Caroline Chaux**](https://www.i2m.univ-amu.fr/perso/caroline.chaux-moulin/) (CNRS, IPAL)
*   [**Dr. Hwee Kuan Lee**](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar/about-cfar/our-team/dr-hwee-kuan-lee) (A*STAR Singapore, IPAL)
